        <p class="p-info">
          Daniel Jacob Radcliffe was born at Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea
          Hospital in Hammersmith, London, England on 23 July 1989,the only
          child of Marcia Jeannine Gresham (n√©e Jacobson)and literary agent Alan
          George Radcliffe.His Jewish mother was born in South Africa, traces
          her ancestry to Jewish immigrants from Germany, Lithuania, Poland, and
          Russia,and was raised in the English town of Westcliff-on-Sea in
          Essex.His Northern Irish father was raised in a "very working-class"
          Protestant family in Banbridge in County Down.[16][17] In 2019, he
          explored both sides of his family history in the BBC genealogy series
          Who Do You Think You Are?Radcliffe's parents had both acted as
          children. As a casting agent, his mother has been involved in BBC
          productions such as The Inspector Lynley Mysteries.Radcliffe was
          educated at three independent schools for boys in London: Redcliffe
          School,Sussex House School,and the City of London School.After the
          release of the first Harry Potter film, attending school proved
          difficult for him as some fellow pupils became hostile, though he
          states that they were just trying to "have a crack at the kid that
          plays Harry Potter" rather than acting out of jealousy.As his acting
          career began to consume his schedule, he continued his education
          through on-set tutors. He has admitted to not being a very good
          student, considering school useless and finding the work "really
          difficult".He achieved A grades in the three AS level exams that he
          took in 2006, but decided to take a break from education and did not
          attend university. Part of his reasoning was that he already knew he
          wanted to be an actor and screenwriter, and that it would be difficult
          to have a normal college experience
